                            Achieving high productivity level is not always simple, especially for remote workers.
                            Every day our productivity takes a hit from various distractions like messages, emails,
                            chores that need to be done or even just our wandering mind. 
                            
                            The pomodoro method is here for the rescue!

                            The pomodoro method, first invented by Francesco Girillo, helps you manage your time.
                            It relies on the basic principle of dividing large tasks in smaller ones that can be 
                            managed in short intervals called pomodoro, usually 25 minutes long. Undertaking a 
                            small task, ensures ones' brain retains focus throughout the interval, and for that 
                            it is rewarded with a small break at the end of the pomodoro.

                            Fun fact, the developer of the method called it pomodoro after the tomato-shaped
                            timer he used to track his work.

                            While the number of employees, who traditionally communicated via personal meetings or telephone but
                            are now forced to work from home, is rising, email is becoming more and more important. However, unless
                            email is used in moderation it can become a distraction. In this section we provide useful email filters
                            and tips to help you organise your email and only be notified of work related emails during your working hours.
