                            The pomodoro method is a time management method.
                            Simply divide your workload in small tasks that can be
                            managed in short intervals, usually 25 minutes long.
                            Start any of your work sessions by making a list of the tasks
                            that you need to do and grab a timer or a watch to track the time.
                            At the end of each interval stand up for a short break or do a few
                            exercises.
                            Fun fact, the developer of the method called it pomodoro after the tomato-shaped
                            timer he used to track his work.

                            While the number of employees, who traditionally communicated via personal meetings or telephone but
                            are now forced to work from home, is rising, email is becoming more and more important. However, unless
                            email is used in moderation it can become a distraction. In this section we provide useful email filters
                            and tips to help you organise your email and only be notified of work related emails during your working hours.
